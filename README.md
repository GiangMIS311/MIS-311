# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of student academic performance across three subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing. It explores relationships between scores and demographic factors such as race/ethnicity and parental education level.

##  Dataset Overview
- 200 simulated student records
- Columns: Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education, Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score

##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel

##  Key Insights
1. **Parental education has a significant impact on student performance.**  
   Students whose parents hold bachelor's or master's degrees score higher on average in all subjects.

2. **There is variability in performance across subjects.**  
   Reading scores tend to be slightly higher than math and writing scores, suggesting possible strengths in literacy.

##  Visualizations
- Bar chart of average scores by parental education
